# Psychiatric-Disorders-Manifold
Code for prototyping adversarial autoencoders for the [AI-ON Psychiatric Disorders Manifold](https://ai-on.org/pdf/thomas-discovering-manifold-psychiatric.pdf) Project.

## Prerequisites
The code was executed with the following installations:
- Python 3.5 (or higher)
- Numpy
- Tensorflow 1.4.0
- Keras 2.1.2
- [Keras-Adversarial](https://github.com/bstriner/keras-adversarial)

## Pretrained Models
Pretrained model weights for the model specified in the notebook can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/27l9au5qxau4zlo/AABk_UYZRP_bixE9axwMGrv5a?dl=0).
## How to Use
Despite being sparse in terms of comments right now, the code in the Notebook
should be relatively easy to understand.
